What does the SUM function do in Anaplan?	The SUM function in Anaplan aggregates values from a source module to a target module using a mapping. It's typically used when the source has more detailed dimensions. Syntax: Source.LineItem[SUM: Mapping]
When should I use LOOKUP instead of SUM in Anaplan?	Use LOOKUP when you're retrieving a specific value based on a one-to-one relationship. It's for pulling values using list or time mappings, not for aggregation. Syntax: Source.LineItem[LOOKUP: Mapping]
What causes a circular reference in Anaplan and how to avoid it?	A circular reference occurs when a line item directly or indirectly depends on its own result. Avoid this by breaking the logic into separate modules or using OFFSET/POST to refer to prior periods.
How is OFFSET used in Anaplan?	OFFSET shifts values forward or backward in time. It's useful for referencing prior or future weeks. Syntax: OFFSET(Line Item, Offset Amount, Substitution Value).
Explain the difference between SELECT and LOOKUP in Anaplan	SELECT is hardcoded and refers to a specific item in a list (e.g., a specific version or time). LOOKUP is dynamic and uses a mapping line item. Use LOOKUP for scalable design.
What is the CUMULATE function used for?	CUMULATE accumulates values across time. It's typically used to build running totals. Syntax: CUMULATE(Line Item, Direction, Reset Boolean).
What is a best practice to avoid hardcoding SELECT in Anaplan models?	Use LOOKUP with a mapping system module instead of SELECT. This ensures scalability and avoids model fragility due to structural changes.
What is the purpose of the POST function in Anaplan?	POST pushes values to a future period based on an offset. Useful in planning scenarios where lead time or delays must be factored. Syntax: POST(Value, Offset Line Item)
How do I handle circular reference when calculating rolling inventory in Anaplan?	Break the logic into multiple line items or use helper modules. Use PREVIOUS or OFFSET to reference prior week's cumulative value instead of the same line item.
Why is aggregation failing in Anaplan with 'incompatible dimensions' error?	This usually occurs when dimensions between source and target do not align. Resolve by checking if your SUM/LOOKUP/SELECT mapping matches dimensionality.
What is the difference between PREVIOUS and OFFSET in Anaplan?	PREVIOUS only works on Time and refers to the immediate prior period. OFFSET is more flexible-it can shift values multiple periods forward or backward.
How can I calculate Weeks of Supply (WoS) in Anaplan?	WoS = Inventory / Average Weekly Demand. Use MOVINGSUM to average demand and make sure time alignment is correct.
What is the formula to calculate Fill Rate in Anaplan?	Fill Rate = Actual Receipts / Orders Placed. Use a helper to cap at 100% and handle 0 denominator cases using IF THEN logic.

How to calculate safety stock?	Safety Stock = Z-score × σ(LT Demand). In Anaplan, estimate standard deviation of lead time demand and apply the formula per SKU-location.
What is a best practice to handle multi-week rolling averages in Anaplan?	Use MOVINGSUM(LineItem, -n + 1, 0) / n. Reset using Booleans if rolling averages restart every X weeks.
What causes 'invalid line item identifier' error in Anaplan imports?	This usually happens when source and target formats (list names or line item headers) don't match or aren't mapped correctly. Ensure correct naming and mapping.
How do I snapshot values across time in Anaplan?	Use a process to copy values into a line item that stores only current week data. Combine with POST or OFFSET to push values across time.

How do you handle mismatched time scales during import?	Map time using 'Fixed Position Pattern' or 'Match Names' with proper time format. Ensure consistency in weekly, monthly, or custom time scales.
Why use a System module for flags like Current Week or Scenario?	System modules centralize logic, reduce redundancy, and make formulas maintainable. They're foundational for scalable model design.
Why is SUM giving aggregation error?	Likely because the 'SUM:' mapping line item is not dimensioned by the list it's mapping to. Fix by adding appropriate mapping dimension to the source line item.
How do you calculate Inventory Turns in Anaplan?	Inventory Turns = Annualized Demand / Average Inventory. Lower inventory or higher demand increases turns. Use MOVINGSUM and conditional time filters.
How to write a formula to avoid negative inventory?	Use MAX(0, Inventory Calculation). Prevents inventory from dropping below zero in projection line items.

It's most commonly used for dimensional transformations like summarizing data from SKU level to Product level. Syntax: `Module.LineItem[SUM: Mapping Line Item]`.
How does LOOKUP work in Anaplan?	LOOKUP retrieves a specific value from another module based on a mapping. It's a one-to-one mapping logic. Syntax: `SourceModule.LineItem[LOOKUP: Mapping Line Item]`. The mapping must match a dimension in the source.
What's the difference between SUM and LOOKUP in Anaplan?	SUM aggregates many-to-one (e.g., SKU to Product), while LOOKUP retrieves a single value using a one-to-one mapping (e.g., Product Code to Product). Use SUM when rolling up data; use LOOKUP when fetching a specific mapped value.

What's the use of PREVIOUS in Anaplan?	PREVIOUS fetches the value of the same line item from the prior time period. Useful in calculating time-dependent metrics like inventory or forecast lags.
How to prevent circular reference while calculating cumulative logic?	Split logic across multiple line items or use OFFSET/POST to decouple direct dependencies. Example: use `Offset(CumValue, -1, 0) + ThisPeriodValue` instead of direct recursion.

How to convert days to weeks in Anaplan?	If a line item stores days as number, divide by 7. Example: `LineItem / 7`. Use `ROUND(LineItem / 7, 1)` for one decimal place.
What is safety stock in supply chain planning?	Safety Stock is the buffer inventory kept to mitigate uncertainties in demand or supply. Formula: `Z * σ * √LT` where Z = service factor, σ = demand variability, LT = lead time.
What is the Reorder Point (ROP)?	ROP is the inventory level at which a replenishment order should be triggered. Formula: `ROP = Safety Stock + (Average Daily Demand × Lead Time)`.
Why is ROP always greater than or equal to Safety Stock?	Because ROP includes safety stock plus expected consumption during lead time. Mathematically: `ROP = SS + D × LT`.
What is inventory turns and how is it improved?	Inventory turns = COGS / Average Inventory. Improve turns by increasing sales or reducing inventory levels. Higher turns indicate efficient inventory usage.
When should we use INNER JOIN in SQL?	Use INNER JOIN when you only want rows with matching keys in both tables. Ideal when working with complete data sets from related entities.
When is LEFT JOIN preferred in SQL?	Use LEFT JOIN when you want all rows from the left table and matching data from the right - helpful for identifying missing data.

How to handle IF/THEN logic based on list items in Anaplan?	Use: `IF LineItem = List.Item THEN Value ELSE Alternative`. For multiple items, consider SWITCH expression or nested IFs.
Can we use ISFIRSTOCCURRENCE in Anaplan?	ISFIRSTOCCURRENCE is used to detect the first appearance of an item in a list. Syntax: `ISFIRSTOCCURRENCE(Item, List)` - often used in numbered lists.
What's the best way to filter time periods dynamically in Anaplan?	Use a SYS Time module with Booleans like `IsCurrentWeek`, `IsForecast`, `IsActuals`, and reference them in module filters.
How to handle time summary in Anaplan for averages?	Set the summary method to `Average` and ensure time scale is weekly or monthly as needed. Use MOVINGSUM for rolling calculations.

What is the difference between 'Sell-In' and 'Sell-Through'?	Sell-In refers to sales from manufacturer to distributor or retailer. Sell-Through refers to sales from retailer to end customer. In Anaplan, model these separately with appropriate hierarchy.
How do you calculate Weeks of Supply (WoS) in Anaplan?	WoS = Inventory / Average Demand. Use MOVINGSUM or custom logic to calculate rolling average demand and guard for division by zero.
What is a good structure for a Scenario Planning module in Anaplan?	Use a Scenario list instead of Versions. Dimension the module by Scenario, use SYS modules to control scenario-specific overrides, inputs, and visualizations.
Why should PREVIOUS not be used across non-time dimensions?	PREVIOUS only works with native Time dimension. Use OFFSET for non-time or when needing to move across multiple periods.
