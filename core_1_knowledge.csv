1,How do I resolve a circular reference in Anaplan?,"To resolve a circular reference in Anaplan, restructure your model using system modules or staging line items. Avoid direct dependency loops by breaking calculations into steps.","anaplan, modeling, circular reference"
2,How to handle timescale mismatch in Anaplan?,Ensure all related line items share the correct times. Use line item-specific time settings or map values using LOOKUP or SELECT from SYS Time modules.,"anaplan, timescale, mismatch, modeling"
3,How to implement a 5-week rolling WoS that resets quarterly?,Use a SYS Time module to flag quarter start weeks. Build a mapping module that rolls forward 5 weeks within each quarter and calculates average demand per block.,"wos, rolling average, supply chain, quarterly logic"
4,When should I use SUM vs LOOKUP in Anaplan?,Use SUM when aggregating across dimensions using a mapping. Use LOOKUP for pulling data via selectors. SUM aggregates; LOOKUP retrieves specific values.,"anaplan, sum, lookup, aggregation"
5,What is the OFFSET function used for in Anaplan?,OFFSET shifts values forward or backward in time based on a numeric offset input. It's useful for lead/lag logic in forecasting.,"anaplan, offset, time functions"
6,What is a good structure for a constrained supply chain model?,"Start with unconstrained demand, layer on constraints via supply plan modules, apply prioritization, and track gaps. Use boolean flags to handle infeasibility.","supply chain, constraint planning, modeling"
7,How can I flag forecast bias in Anaplan?,Calculate forecast bias as (Forecast - Actual)/Actual. Flag high/low values using thresholds. Use this in demand review dashboards.,"forecast bias, analytics, demand planning"
8,What is the use of a SYS module in Anaplan?,"SYS modules store time mappings, booleans, constants, and attributes. They support logic and improve model auditability and reuse.","anaplan, sys module, best practices"
9,What is a RAG status and how to apply it?,RAG (Red-Amber-Green) status is a visual logic for KPIs. Use boolean flags or value ranges and apply conditional formatting in UX.,"RAG, reporting, visualization"
10,How to avoid double counting in Anaplan calculations?,Ensure the correct dimensional context. Use LOOKUP only when mapping across lists. Avoid multiple SUM layers across same dimensions.,"anaplan, double counting, logic validation"
